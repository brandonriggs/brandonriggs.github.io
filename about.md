Hello, I'm Brandon from IT!

If you're visiting this page, you most likely already know who I am. For those of you who don't know me, please continue reading.

### The Boring Stuff

As an aspiring information security professional, my job duties often overlap. At the end of the day, yes, I fix computers and promote synergy. I also make my best attempts at preventing people from clicking links.

Having been recently let go (I prefer the term "surprise unemployment"), I'm currently seeking opportunities in the IT/IS field. Lots of experience with all the things. Drop me a line if you're looking!
