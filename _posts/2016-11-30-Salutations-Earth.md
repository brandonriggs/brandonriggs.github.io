My first blog post on GitHub! Nice. It will probably never get updated again.

I'll have to admit that being able to post from a terminal emulator is pretty cool, though.

With any luck, this blog will serve as a drawing board, showcase, and scratch paper for my projects and ideas. I may even post a tutorial or two (crazy talk, I know).

Until next time...
